# bigbob
A chat client built on top of my tokenizer, toky with the help of python in the mix for gathering web results.
## Now how does it work?
When you run the program, youre given a prompt. Based on whatever you type in the prompt, <br />
my program first checks my very limited dataset for a response and prints it out. <br />
If it fails to get a response then it checks google for the most appropriate results related to the prompt <br />
and gets you a response.

## Installation
Here are the installation instructions. <br />
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bcbro2021/bigbob.git
cd bigbob
cargo run
```
