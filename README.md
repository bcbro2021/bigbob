# bigbob
A chat client built on top of my tokenizer, toky with the help of python in the mix for gathering web results.

## Now how does it work?
When you run the program, youre given a prompt. Based on whatever you type in the prompt, <br />
the program first checks my very limited dataset for a response and prints it out. <br />
If it fails to get a response then it checks google for the most appropriate results related to the prompt <br />
and gets you a response.

## Let's try it
This is the responses i got for my questions.

```sh
>who are you?

I am a simple nlp testing agent created with nothing but the standard library and a tokenizer also built from scratch in rust

>what is your name?
